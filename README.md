# GymRats Android

This project is a hacky clone of the [ios version](https://gitlab.com/gym-rats/ios-app) of the app. Not a whole lot of care went into learning best practices and I got pretty fed up with XML. Kotlin is great, but its Java roots holds it back. Android is the worst. I've learned so much about staying lean and building an MVP, because it would mean less time writing code on this platform.
